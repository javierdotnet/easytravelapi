# easytravelapi

A travel web service specification to replace the unfortunately dead Caval.

Use it if you want ;)


## workflow

I will define the web services using java and jax-ws + jax-rs.

wsdl and wadl will be generated from java classes.

Documentation will be automatically generated by means of javadoc and xsls
