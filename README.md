# easy travel api

A travel web service specification to replace the unfortunately dead Caval.

Use it if you want ;)


## workflow

I will define the web services using java and jax-ws + jax-rs.

wsdl and wadl will be generated from java classes.

swagger files will be generated from annotated java classes.

You will be able to generate server and client side code from swagger.
